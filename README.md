# NSL-KDD-Data-Analysis
This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and “good” normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.


## Data Resources
You can download the dataset via the [link](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html), NSL KDD training set is a modified version of original KDD-90 dataset. It has 125972 rows and 42 columns, with each row representing a connection with either normal or one of other 22 attack types.

## Attack Categories
1) Denial of Service Attack (DoS):is an attack inwhich the attacker makes some computing or memoryresource too busy or too full to handle legitimate re-quests, or denies legitimate users access to a machine.

2) User to Root Attack (U2R):is a class of exploit inwhich the attacker starts out with access to a normaluser account on the system (perhaps gained by sniffingpasswords, a dictionary attack, or social engineering)and is able to exploit some vulnerability to gain rootaccess to the system.

3) Remote to Local Attack (R2L):occurs when anattacker who has the ability to send packets to amachine over a network but who does not have anaccount on that machine exploits some vulnerability togain local access as a user of that machine.

4) Probing Attack:is an attempt to gather informationabout a network of computers for the apparent purposeof circumventing its security controls.
